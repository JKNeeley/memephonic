Submitted for TigerHacks 2023

## Developer Rubric Adherence
Creativity
- How well did the participant come up with a unique or unexpected idea? For example, using a novel technology in unexpected ways or cleverly combining technology or solving a problem. Perhaps exploring new forms of media or coming at existing media in new and exciting ways?

Functionality
- Does the project work as intended? How well does the demo run on the
presentation video and/or on the judge's laptop? Are there any glaring
bugs?

Technical Implementation
- How well was the project technically executed? This includes the efficiency of the code, proper use of relevant technologies, and overall technical complexity.

User Experience
- How user-friendly is the project? Does it feel nice to use? Does it feel natural or have a clever way of interacting with the program?

Usefulness
- Could this be something someone in media or otherwise uses every day? Does this tackle a real problem?

Learning and Innovation
- Earned points for learning a new technology/skill or taking a currently known language to new heights. Teams should be clear in their
presentations about what they learned and how they pushed the boundaries of technology.

Presentation
- How well does the team show off their work to the judges via the demo, video, and/or writing? Is the presentation of the project clever, witty, or unique?

Collaboration
- Did the team collaborate effectively and mention any mentors they worked with? Explain how collaboration positively impacted the project.

Bonus
- Something unique or wildly out of the box the team did to make their project stand out.
